## About Me

I’ve been fascinated by computers and cybersecurity since a young age, 
experimenting with networks, VMs, and basic programming. Over the years, 
I’ve built hands-on experience through labs, and personal projects, 
developing skills in penetration testing, networking, and defensive security.
